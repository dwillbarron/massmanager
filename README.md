# massmanager (graveyarded)
Simultaneous management and monitoring of large numbers of Linux devices (i.e. Raspberry Pis)

Making this repository public as part of my effort to go back and document previous projects.  
A lot of this works rather well, but if you plan on using it I recommend stripping out the commmand system as it doesn't have any form of authentication.
You may also wish to remove a few of the kludges I used in Javascript in order to dynamically add/remove content, as parts of this project were done on a sort of time crunch.
This was a very satisfying project, however, and I enjoyed working on it.
